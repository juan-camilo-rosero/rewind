## üñåÔ∏è Rewind üñåÔ∏è

This project is part of the DevPost Vitality Hacks 2024. Rewind is a web application where users can discover new places through gamification. You must search for works of art in your city, and scan the corresponding QR code to unlock the next point on your trip. You have an AI assistant that will answer your questions about the artwork, and when you finish your journey, you'll be able to collect a price.

## Deployment

To deploy the Rewind web application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rewind.git
```

Replace your-username with your GitHub username if you've forked the repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

```bash
cd rewind
```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Run the Development Server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Access the Application:**

Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to access the Rewind web application.

## Aditional notes

* The Firebase API key and ChatGPT API key are stored as environment variables, so you need to configure them in a .env file in the root directory of the project. Make sure not to expose these keys publicly.
